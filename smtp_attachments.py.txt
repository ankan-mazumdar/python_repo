'''
There are quite a few ways to attach files to an email, but this is one of the simpler ways. This time we will use an encoder and MIMEMultipart from the email module and os.path to simply get the filename from the provided path.

This method supports text files, images, videos, audio and pdfs.

Once again, replacing the previous variables but setting the new variable 'file_location' to the location of the tile that you want to send, the email will now send with the file attached.
